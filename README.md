# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

Sprint 2 Coffee Shop
This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. This project showcases multiple differnt techniques and feautures for creating a landing page. This project includes imbedding videos, organizing BEM files, creating and styling forms, and CSS animatiomn and transformations.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would like to add an element in the corner of the form or somewhere on the viewscreen that informs the viewer that in the information has been saved successfully. An email or text message for conformation to be sent after the form is completed also sounds like a productive addition.
